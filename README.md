# Bias-mitigation-with-a-Keras-Embedding
This project aims at finding an approach that allows 
to handle truncated targeted features in a linear regression problem. 
Let's say we know that there is a linear relation between some features and a target variable. 
Is it possible to compute the exact weights given truncated target variables?
